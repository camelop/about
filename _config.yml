  I am a Ph.D. student in the EECS department at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) advised by [Professor Dawn Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/). Before joining UC Berkeley, I received my bachelor's degree from [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am a member of [Berkeley Center for Responsible, Decentralized Intelligence (RDI)](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/), [Initiative for Cryptocurrencies & Contracts Lab (IC3)](https://www.initc3.org/), and [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/).
  - **Research Interest**: I am broadly interested in **computer security**, **systems**, and **machine learning**, especially building systems that enable secure and privacy-preserving data processing or solve real-world security problems.

  - **Nov 2022**: *"The practical use of differential privacy across the enterprise is within striking distance."* Check out [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03898) accepted to PETS 2022.  
  - **Oct 2022**: Released [CoLink](https://colink.app/), a project focusing on creating decentralized programming abstractions. Check out our talk at [NIPS 2022 Workshop](https://ai-secure.github.io/DMLW2022/speakers).

  I am a Ph.D. student in the EECS department at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) advised by [Professor Dawn Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/). Before joining UC Berkeley, I received my bachelor's degree from [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am a member of [Berkeley Center for Responsible, Decentralized Intelligence (RDI)](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/), [Initiative for Cryptocurrencies & Contracts Lab (IC3)](https://www.initc3.org/), and [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/).
  - **Research Interest**: I am broadly interested in **computer security**, **systems**, and **machine learning**, especially building systems that enable secure and privacy-preserving data processing or solve real-world security problems.
